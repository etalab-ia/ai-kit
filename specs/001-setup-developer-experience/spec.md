# Feature Specification: Setup Developer Experience & Tooling for ai-kit

**Feature Branch**: `001-setup-developer-experience`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'd like to address principle IX so that we can setup the developer experience and tooling we expect of users of ai-kit for ai-kit itself."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Core Developer Tooling Setup (Priority: P1)

As an ai-kit core contributor, I need the repository configured with standardized Python tooling (uv, ruff, just) so that I can develop, test, and maintain the codebase efficiently following the same standards we mandate for ai-kit users.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational - without proper tooling, all subsequent development work will be inconsistent and inefficient. It establishes the baseline developer experience that makes all other work possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by cloning the repository, running setup commands, and verifying that linting, formatting, and task execution work correctly. Delivers immediate value by enabling consistent development practices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh clone of the ai-kit repository, **When** a developer runs the setup command, **Then** uv installs all dependencies and creates a working development environment
2. **Given** the development environment is set up, **When** a developer runs the lint command, **Then** ruff checks all Python code for style violations and reports results
3. **Given** code with formatting issues, **When** a developer runs the format command, **Then** ruff automatically fixes formatting to match project standards
4. **Given** the repository is configured, **When** a developer runs `just --list`, **Then** all available development tasks are displayed with descriptions

### User Story 2 - Monorepo Structure with Turborepo (Priority: P2)

As an ai-kit core contributor, I need the repository organized as a monorepo with Turborepo so that I can manage multiple packages (libraries, templates, tools) with efficient caching and parallel execution.

**Why this priority**: ai-kit will contain multiple packages (core library, templates, CLI tools, etc.). Setting up monorepo infrastructure early prevents the "multiple disconnected repos" anti-pattern and enables efficient CI/CD.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple packages in the monorepo, making changes, and verifying that Turborepo correctly caches builds and runs tasks in parallel. Delivers value by enabling multi-package development.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the monorepo structure is configured, **When** a developer builds all packages, **Then** Turborepo executes builds in dependency order with caching
2. **Given** a package has been built previously, **When** a developer rebuilds without changes, **Then** Turborepo uses cached results and skips unnecessary work
3. **Given** multiple packages need testing, **When** a developer runs tests, **Then** Turborepo executes tests in parallel across packages
4. **Given** a change to one package, **When** a developer rebuilds, **Then** only affected packages and their dependents are rebuilt

---

### User Story 3 - CI/CD Pipeline Integration (Priority: P3)

As an ai-kit core contributor, I need CI/CD pipelines configured to use the same tooling (uv, ruff, just, Turborepo) so that automated checks match local development and catch issues before merge.

**Why this priority**: Ensures consistency between local and CI environments, prevents "works on my machine" issues, and automates quality gates.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by pushing code changes and verifying that CI runs linting, formatting checks, tests, and builds using the configured tooling. Delivers value by automating quality assurance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request is opened, **When** CI runs, **Then** ruff linting and formatting checks execute and report violations
2. **Given** code passes linting, **When** CI continues, **Then** all tests execute using uv-managed dependencies
3. **Given** tests pass, **When** CI builds packages, **Then** Turborepo caching reduces build time compared to clean builds
4. **Given** any check fails, **When** CI completes, **Then** the pull request is blocked from merging with clear error messages

---

### User Story 4 - Developer Documentation (Priority: P3)

As a new ai-kit contributor, I need clear documentation on how to set up my development environment and use the tooling so that I can start contributing quickly without tribal knowledge.

**Why this priority**: Reduces onboarding friction and ensures all contributors follow the same practices. Lower priority than tooling setup itself but critical for team scalability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a new contributor follow the documentation from scratch and successfully complete their first contribution. Delivers value by enabling self-service onboarding.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new contributor reads the setup documentation, **When** they follow the steps, **Then** they have a working development environment without asking for help
2. **Given** a contributor wants to run tests, **When** they check the documentation, **Then** they find clear commands for running tests locally
3. **Given** a contributor wants to add a new package, **When** they check the documentation, **Then** they find instructions for creating packages in the monorepo structure
4. **Given** CI fails on a pull request, **When** a contributor checks the documentation, **Then** they find troubleshooting steps for common CI issues

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer has an older version of Python installed that doesn't meet minimum requirements?
- How does the system handle conflicts between globally installed tools (pip, virtualenv) and uv?
- What happens when Turborepo cache becomes corrupted or outdated?
- How does the system handle platform-specific differences (macOS vs Linux vs Windows)?
- What happens when a developer tries to use incompatible versions of dependencies?
- How does CI handle transient network failures when installing dependencies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Repository MUST use uv for Python package and dependency management
- **FR-002**: Repository MUST use ruff for linting and code formatting with a shared configuration
- **FR-003**: Repository MUST use just as the task runner with documented commands for common development tasks
- **FR-004**: Repository MUST be structured as a Turborepo monorepo with clear package organization
- **FR-005**: Turborepo MUST be configured with caching for builds, tests, and linting tasks
- **FR-006**: All Python code MUST pass ruff linting checks before merge
- **FR-007**: All Python code MUST be formatted with ruff using project-standard configuration
- **FR-008**: CI pipeline MUST use the same tooling versions as local development
- **FR-009**: CI pipeline MUST execute linting, formatting checks, tests, and builds on every pull request
- **FR-010**: Developer documentation MUST include setup instructions, common commands, and troubleshooting guides
- **FR-011**: Repository MUST specify minimum Python version requirements
- **FR-012**: Repository MUST include a justfile with commands for: setup, lint, format, test, build, clean
- **FR-013**: Turborepo MUST support parallel execution of independent tasks across packages
- **FR-014**: CI MUST fail fast on linting or formatting violations before running expensive tests
- **FR-015**: Repository MUST include pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting (optional for developers but recommended)

### Key Entities

- **Development Environment**: The local setup on a contributor's machine, including Python version, uv installation, and cloned repository
- **Package**: A distinct module within the monorepo (e.g., core library, CLI tool, template collection)
- **Task**: A development operation (lint, format, test, build) that can be executed via just or Turborepo
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated workflow that runs on pull requests to validate code quality and functionality
- **Configuration Files**: Files that define tooling behavior (pyproject.toml for ruff/uv, turbo.json for Turborepo, justfile for tasks)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
