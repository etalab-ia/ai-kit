# Specification Quality Checklist: Setup Developer Experience & Tooling for ai-kit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-12

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on WHAT (tooling setup, developer experience) and WHY (consistency, efficiency, compliance with Principle IX) without specifying HOW to implement. Uses tools by name (uv, ruff, just, Turborepo) as requirements, not implementation details, which is appropriate for this infrastructure feature.

✅ **PASS** - Clearly focused on developer value: faster onboarding, consistent development practices, efficient CI/CD, reduced friction.

✅ **PASS** - Written in plain language accessible to project managers and stakeholders. Technical tool names are necessary context but explained through their purpose.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements are testable:
- FR-001-003: Can verify by checking configuration files
- FR-004-005: Can verify by examining repository structure and turbo.json
- FR-006-007: Can verify by running linting/formatting checks
- FR-008-015: Can verify through CI pipeline execution and documentation review

✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: 10 minutes setup time
- SC-002: 30 seconds for lint/format
- SC-003: 50% CI build time reduction
- SC-004: 100% code compliance
- SC-005: 5 minutes CI completion
- SC-006: Zero environment issues (qualitative but verifiable)
- SC-007: Single-command execution (verifiable)
- SC-008: Positive feedback from 3+ contributors (measurable)

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria focus on outcomes (setup time, check speed, cache effectiveness) without specifying implementation approaches.

✅ **PASS** - All 4 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases section identifies 6 relevant scenarios covering version conflicts, platform differences, cache corruption, and network failures.

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to developer tooling setup for ai-kit itself. Explicitly excludes end-user tooling or application features.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies (Python version, tool installations) and assumptions (developers have basic Git/GitHub knowledge) are implicit but clear from context. Key entities section documents the development environment structure.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories. For example:
- FR-001-003 (uv, ruff, just) → User Story 1 acceptance scenarios
- FR-004-005 (Turborepo) → User Story 2 acceptance scenarios
- FR-008-009 (CI) → User Story 3 acceptance scenarios
- FR-010 (documentation) → User Story 4 acceptance scenarios

✅ **PASS** - Four prioritized user stories cover:
- P1: Core tooling setup (foundational)
- P2: Monorepo structure (enables multi-package development)
- P3: CI/CD integration (automates quality)
- P3: Developer documentation (enables onboarding)

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria align with user story outcomes:
- SC-001, SC-008 → User Story 4 (documentation/onboarding)
- SC-002, SC-004, SC-007 → User Story 1 (tooling efficiency)
- SC-003 → User Story 2 (monorepo caching)
- SC-005, SC-006 → User Story 3 (CI/CD effectiveness)

✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains technology-agnostic language in outcomes while appropriately naming required tools (uv, ruff, just, Turborepo) as mandated by Principle IX.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`. All quality criteria pass:

1. **Content Quality**: Focuses on developer value and business needs without implementation details
2. **Requirement Completeness**: All requirements testable, success criteria measurable, no clarifications needed
3. **Feature Readiness**: User scenarios cover all primary flows with clear acceptance criteria

**Key Strengths**:
- Directly addresses Constitution Principle IX (Developer Experience & Tooling Consistency)
- Clear prioritization enables incremental delivery (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
- Success criteria are specific and measurable
- Edge cases anticipate common developer environment issues

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- No clarifications or spec updates required
