# Specification Quality Checklist: Jupyter Notebook Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without implementation details. Written for business stakeholders and compliance officers. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 49 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Zero notebooks with hardcoded credentials" rather than "nbstripout hook configured"). Edge cases comprehensively identified including git-native workflow considerations. Scope clearly bounded by constitution Principle XIII. CLI architecture designed for extensibility beyond notebooks.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 5 user stories have clear acceptance scenarios. Stories are prioritized (P1-P5) and independently testable. Success criteria align with user scenarios and business value. No implementation leakage detected.

## Notes

- Specification is based on Principle XIII (Jupyter Notebook Discipline) from the project constitution
- Security requirements are marked as non-negotiable, reflecting constitutional mandate
- EU AI Act and GDPR compliance requirements are explicitly documented
- Feature scope is well-bounded: focuses on governance, security, and compliance infrastructure rather than notebook execution features
- All success criteria are measurable and verifiable without implementation details

### Option 2 (Hybrid) Implementation (2025-10-14)
- **Archive directory removed**: Changed from 7 to 6 notebook categories
- **Git-native lifecycle**: Exploratory notebooks deleted after migration (git history preserves)
- **Selective retention**: Compliance/evaluation notebooks retained and tagged for audit
- **Experiment tracking**: Added integration requirements (FR-040 to FR-042) as future consideration
- **Rationale**: Eliminates clutter while maintaining regulatory compliance through git tags
- **See**: `OPTION2_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed change summary

### Unified CLI Architecture (2025-10-14)
- **Strategic decision**: Unified ai-kit CLI in `apps/cli/` instead of notebook-specific CLI
- **Command structure**: `just notebook <subcommand>` pattern (create, list, validate, delete, migrate, stats)
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports future command groups (dataset, streamlit, compliance, experiment, proconnect)
- **Benefits**: Consistent DX, shared infrastructure, single entry point, future-proof
- **Requirements added**: FR-008 through FR-008g for CLI architecture and commands
- **Success criteria added**: SC-013, SC-014, SC-015 for CLI usability and discoverability
- **Rationale**: Better long-term architecture, avoids CLI proliferation, enables cross-feature workflows

## Recommendation

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - Specification passes all quality checks and is ready for `/speckit.plan` workflow.
