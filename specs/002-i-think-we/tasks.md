# Tasks: Jupyter Notebook Support

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-i-think-we/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo infrastructure**: `apps/cli/`, `notebooks/`, `packages/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `justfile`
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for unified ai-kit CLI

- [x] T001 Create `apps/cli/` directory structure with `src/ai_kit/cli/` package (per Constitution Principle XV - unified ai_kit namespace)
- [x] T002 Create `apps/cli/pyproject.toml` with dependencies (click/typer, questionary, rich, nbformat, ruamel.yaml)
- [x] T003 [P] Create `notebooks/` directory structure with 6 categories (exploratory, tutorials, evaluations, compliance, reporting, templates)
- [x] T004 [P] Add `.gitkeep` files to each notebook category directory
- [x] T005 [P] Create `docs/notebooks/` directory for governance documentation
- [x] T006 Configure `apps/cli/` as uv workspace package in root `pyproject.toml`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core CLI infrastructure and shared utilities that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T007 Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/__init__.py` with version info and namespace package configuration
- [x] T008 Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/main.py` with CLI entry point and command routing
- [x] T009 [P] Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/core/config.py` for CLI configuration management
- [x] T010 [P] Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/core/validators.py` for shared validation logic
- [x] T011 [P] Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/core/templates.py` for template management utilities
- [x] T012 [P] Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/utils/git.py` for git operations (tags, history, status)
- [x] T013 [P] Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/utils/prompts.py` for interactive prompts (questionary wrappers)
- [x] T014 [P] Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/utils/output.py` for formatted output (rich console)
- [x] T015 Create `apps/cli/src/ai_kit/cli/commands/__init__.py` for command group registration
- [x] T016 Add `notebook` command group registration to `justfile` (routes to `apps/cli/`)
- [x] T017 [P] Create test structure in `apps/cli/tests/` mirroring source layout (commands/, core/, utils/ subdirectories) with pytest configuration

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Security) ‚Üí US2 (Categories) ‚Üí US2 (CLI) ‚Üí US3 (Reproducibility) ‚Üí US4 (Migration) ‚Üí US4 (Tagging) ‚Üí US5 (Compliance)
  - Sequential dependencies due to shared infrastructure (templates, validators, CLI commands)
- **Additional Commands (Phase 10)**: Depends on US2 (CLI) completion
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Security)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Categories)**: Depends on US1 (needs security hooks in place)
- **User Story 2 (CLI)**: Depends on US2 (Categories) (needs templates and validators)
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Reproducibility)**: Depends on US2 (needs templates to update)
- **User Story 4 (P4 - Migration)**: Depends on US2 (CLI) (extends CLI commands)
- **User Story 4 (Tagging)**: Depends on US4 (Migration) (same story, sequential parts)
- **User Story 5 (P5 - Compliance)**: Depends on US2 (needs templates to update)

### Within Each User Story

- Pre-commit hooks before CLI commands (security first)
- Templates before CLI create command (need templates to copy)
- Validators before commands (need validation logic)
- Core implementation before additional commands
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different directories)
- Phase 2: T009-T014 can run in parallel (different files)
- Phase 3 (Secret Scanning): T018, T025 can run in parallel (nbstripout dependency, Gitleaks config)
- Phase 3 (Validation): T030, T031 can run in parallel (different validators)
- Phase 3 (Documentation): T035-T038 can run in parallel (different documentation files)
- Phase 4: T041-T045 can run in parallel (different template files)
- Phase 6: T068-T070 can run in parallel (different dependencies)
- Phase 10: T107-T110, T115-T118 can run in parallel (different subcommands)
- Phase 11: T119-T131 can run in parallel (different documentation/test files)

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Templates)

```bash
# Launch all template creation tasks together:
Task T041: "Create exploratory template in notebooks/templates/exploratory-template.ipynb"
Task T042: "Create tutorial template in notebooks/templates/tutorial-template.ipynb"
Task T043: "Create evaluation template in notebooks/templates/evaluation-template.ipynb"
Task T044: "Create compliance template in notebooks/templates/compliance-template.ipynb"
Task T045: "Create reporting template in notebooks/templates/reporting-template.ipynb"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Pre-commit hooks are critical path - test thoroughly
- CLI commands build incrementally - start with `create`, add others later
- Templates are foundation for good metadata - invest time in quality
- Documentation is essential for compliance officers and developers
- Unified CLI architecture enables future extensions (dataset, streamlit, compliance, experiment commands)

---
