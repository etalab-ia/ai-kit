# Tasks: Jupyter Notebook Support

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-i-think-we/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Monorepo infrastructure**: `apps/cli/`, `notebooks/`, `packages/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `justfile`
- All paths relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for unified ai-kit CLI

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Security) ‚Üí US2 (Categories) ‚Üí US2 (CLI) ‚Üí US3 (Reproducibility) ‚Üí US4 (Migration) ‚Üí US4 (Tagging) ‚Üí US5 (Compliance)
  - Sequential dependencies due to shared infrastructure (templates, validators, CLI commands)
- **Additional Commands (Phase 10)**: Depends on US2 (CLI) completion
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Security)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Categories)**: Depends on US1 (needs security hooks in place)
- **User Story 2 (CLI)**: Depends on US2 (Categories) (needs templates and validators)
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Reproducibility)**: Depends on US2 (needs templates to update)
- **User Story 4 (P4 - Migration)**: Depends on US2 (CLI) (extends CLI commands)
- **User Story 4 (Tagging)**: Depends on US4 (Migration) (same story, sequential parts)
- **User Story 5 (P5 - Compliance)**: Depends on US2 (needs templates to update)

### Within Each User Story

- Pre-commit hooks before CLI commands (security first)
- Templates before CLI create command (need templates to copy)
- Validators before commands (need validation logic)
- Core implementation before additional commands
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different directories)
- Phase 2: T009-T014 can run in parallel (different files)
- Phase 3: T018, T019, T023, T024, T027 can run in parallel (different files)
- Phase 4: T031-T035 can run in parallel (different template files)
- Phase 6: T058-T060 can run in parallel (different dependencies)
- Phase 10: T097-T100, T105-T108 can run in parallel (different subcommands)
- Phase 11: T109-T118 can run in parallel (different documentation/test files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Templates)

```bash
# Launch all template creation tasks together:
Task T031: "Create exploratory template in notebooks/templates/exploratory-template.ipynb"
Task T032: "Create tutorial template in notebooks/templates/tutorial-template.ipynb"
Task T033: "Create evaluation template in notebooks/templates/evaluation-template.ipynb"
Task T034: "Create compliance template in notebooks/templates/compliance-template.ipynb"
Task T035: "Create reporting template in notebooks/templates/reporting-template.ipynb"
```

6. Polish ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T017)
2. Developer A: User Story 1 (Security) (T018-T030)
3. Once US1 done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Categories) (T031-T042)
   - Developer B: Start preparing User Story 3 dependencies
4. Once US2 done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (CLI) (T043-T057)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Reproducibility) (T058-T068)
5. Continue with US4, US5, Additional Commands in parallel where possible

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US5)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Pre-commit hooks are critical path - test thoroughly
- CLI commands build incrementally - start with `create`, add others later
- Templates are foundation for good metadata - invest time in quality
- Documentation is essential for compliance officers and developers
- Unified CLI architecture enables future extensions (dataset, streamlit, compliance, experiment commands)
