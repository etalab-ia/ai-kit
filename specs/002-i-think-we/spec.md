# Feature Specification: Jupyter Notebook Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-think-we`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I think we are ready now to support notebooks as specified in our constitution."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Security-Compliant Notebook Creation (Priority: P1)

A data scientist needs to create a new exploratory notebook to analyze model performance without risking credential leakage or compliance violations.

**Why this priority**: Security requirements are non-negotiable and must be enforced from the first notebook commit. This prevents the most critical risk: accidental exposure of credentials or sensitive data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a notebook with test credentials, committing it, and verifying that outputs are stripped and no credentials are committed to version control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a new notebook in `notebooks/exploratory/`, **When** they commit the notebook with cell outputs, **Then** the pre-commit hook automatically strips all outputs before commit
2. **Given** a developer attempts to commit a notebook with hardcoded credentials, **When** the pre-commit hook runs, **Then** the commit is blocked with a clear error message indicating the security violation
3. **Given** a developer creates a notebook, **When** they reference the notebook template, **Then** they see clear documentation on security requirements and how to use environment variables for credentials

---

### User Story 2 - Organized Notebook Categories (Priority: P2)

A team member needs to understand where to place their notebook based on its purpose and governance requirements.

**Why this priority**: Clear categorization prevents confusion and ensures appropriate governance is applied. This is the foundation for all other notebook workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating notebooks in each category directory and verifying that the correct governance rules and documentation standards are enforced for each.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to do rapid experimentation, **When** they create a notebook in `notebooks/exploratory/`, **Then** they can work freely without SpecKit workflow requirements
2. **Given** a developer creates a tutorial notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/documentation/`, **Then** they are prompted to follow documentation standards and link it to relevant specs
3. **Given** a developer creates a model evaluation notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/production-adjacent/`, **Then** they are prompted to document EU AI Act compliance requirements
4. **Given** a notebook is no longer needed, **When** it is moved to `notebooks/archive/`, **Then** it is preserved for audit purposes but excluded from active development

---

### User Story 3 - Reproducible Notebook Execution (Priority: P3)

A team member needs to run someone else's notebook and get the same results without dependency conflicts.

**Why this priority**: Reproducibility is essential for collaboration and compliance, but can be established after security and organization are in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having one developer create a notebook with dependencies, another developer clone the repository, and successfully execute the notebook with identical results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a notebook has documented dependencies, **When** a developer sets up the environment using the documented requirements, **Then** the notebook executes successfully without errors
2. **Given** a notebook uses data sources, **When** another developer runs it, **Then** they can access the same data sources through documented paths or environment variables
3. **Given** a notebook is parameterized, **When** it is executed programmatically with different parameters, **Then** it produces consistent results for the same inputs

---

### User Story 4 - Notebook-to-Production Migration (Priority: P4)

A developer has validated an approach in a notebook and needs to migrate it to production code in the monorepo.

**Why this priority**: This enables the value of exploration to reach production, but only after the foundational notebook infrastructure is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an exploratory notebook, extracting its logic to a package, documenting the migration, and archiving the original notebook.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an exploratory notebook has validated code, **When** the developer extracts it to `packages/` or `apps/`, **Then** the migration is documented in the feature spec with a link to the archived notebook
2. **Given** a production-adjacent notebook contains compliance documentation, **When** code is migrated to production, **Then** the notebook is retained for audit purposes and referenced in the compliance dossier
3. **Given** a notebook is migrated to production, **When** it is moved to `notebooks/archive/`, **Then** it includes metadata about when it was migrated and where the production code lives

---

### User Story 5 - EU AI Act Compliance Documentation (Priority: P5)

A compliance officer needs to generate technical documentation for a high-risk AI system using notebooks as evidence.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for regulated systems but only applies to production-adjacent notebooks for high-risk AI systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a production-adjacent notebook with model evaluation metrics and verifying that it includes all required EU AI Act documentation elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a production-adjacent notebook evaluates a model, **When** it is reviewed for compliance, **Then** it documents training data characteristics, evaluation metrics, and risk assessment findings
2. **Given** a model selection decision is made, **When** documented in a notebook, **Then** the notebook provides an audit trail showing why the model was chosen
3. **Given** a compliance officer needs technical documentation, **When** they review production-adjacent notebooks, **Then** they find all required information for the homologation dossier

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer accidentally commits a notebook with credentials before the pre-commit hook is installed?
- How does the system handle notebooks that are too large to be stored in git (e.g., with embedded large datasets)?
- What happens when a notebook depends on external data sources that are no longer available?
- How does the system handle notebooks that take hours to execute?
- What happens when a notebook is moved between categories (e.g., from exploratory to production-adjacent)?
- How does the system handle notebooks that use different Python versions or incompatible dependencies?
- What happens when a notebook needs to be shared publicly but contains references to internal systems?
