## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Security-Compliant Notebook Creation (Priority: P1)

A data scientist needs to create a new exploratory notebook to analyze model performance without risking credential leakage or compliance violations.

**Why this priority**: Security requirements are non-negotiable and must be enforced from the first notebook commit. This prevents the most critical risk: accidental exposure of credentials or sensitive data.

**Measurable Security Criteria**:
- **Zero credential commits**: 100% of commits with hardcoded credentials, API keys, or secrets are blocked by pre-commit hooks (SC-001)
- **Complete output stripping**: 100% of notebook outputs are automatically stripped before commit (SC-002)
- **Size enforcement**: Notebooks exceeding 10 MB are blocked with clear error messages (FR-006a)
- **Metadata validation**: 100% of notebooks have required metadata fields (purpose, author, category) validated before commit (FR-018a)

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a notebook with test credentials, committing it, and verifying that outputs are stripped and no credentials are committed to version control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a new notebook in `notebooks/exploratory/`, **When** they commit the notebook with cell outputs, **Then** the pre-commit hook automatically strips all outputs before commit
2. **Given** a developer attempts to commit a notebook with hardcoded credentials, **When** the pre-commit hook runs, **Then** the commit is blocked with a clear error message indicating the security violation
3. **Given** a developer creates a notebook, **When** they reference the notebook template, **Then** they see clear documentation on security requirements and how to use environment variables for credentials

---

### User Story 2 - Organized Notebook Categories (Priority: P2)

A team member needs to understand where to place their notebook based on its purpose and governance requirements.

**Why this priority**: Clear categorization prevents confusion and ensures appropriate governance is applied. This is the foundation for all other notebook workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating notebooks in each category directory and verifying that the correct governance rules and documentation standards are enforced for each.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to do rapid experimentation, **When** they create a notebook in `notebooks/exploratory/`, **Then** they can work freely without SpecKit workflow requirements
2. **Given** a developer creates a tutorial notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/tutorials/`, **Then** they are prompted to follow documentation standards and link it to relevant specs
3. **Given** a developer creates a model evaluation notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/evaluations/`, **Then** they are prompted to document performance metrics and validation methodology
4. **Given** a developer creates a compliance documentation notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/compliance/`, **Then** they are prompted to document EU AI Act requirements and risk assessments
5. **Given** a developer creates a recurring stakeholder report, **When** they place it in `notebooks/reporting/`, **Then** they are prompted to parameterize it for automated execution
6. **Given** a developer needs a starter notebook, **When** they copy from `notebooks/templates/`, **Then** they get a pre-structured notebook with required metadata and security guidance
7. **Given** an exploratory notebook is no longer needed, **When** the developer deletes it, **Then** git history preserves the work for future reference
8. **Given** a compliance or evaluation notebook must be retained for audit purposes, **When** it is tagged in git with a descriptive tag, **Then** it remains easily discoverable for regulatory review without cluttering active directories

---

### User Story 3 - Reproducible Notebook Execution (Priority: P3)

A team member needs to run someone else's notebook and get the same results without dependency conflicts.

**Why this priority**: Reproducibility is essential for collaboration and compliance, but can be established after security and organization are in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having one developer create a notebook with dependencies, another developer clone the repository, and successfully execute the notebook with identical results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a notebook has documented dependencies, **When** a developer sets up the environment using the documented requirements, **Then** the notebook executes successfully without errors
2. **Given** a notebook uses data sources, **When** another developer runs it, **Then** they can access the same data sources through documented paths or environment variables
3. **Given** a notebook is parameterized, **When** it is executed programmatically with different parameters, **Then** it produces consistent results for the same inputs

---

### User Story 4 - Notebook-to-Production Migration (Priority: P4)

A developer has validated an approach in a notebook and needs to migrate it to production code in the monorepo.

**Why this priority**: This enables the value of exploration to reach production, but only after the foundational notebook infrastructure is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an exploratory notebook, extracting its logic to a package, documenting the migration in the spec, and deleting the original notebook (git history preserves it).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an exploratory notebook has validated code, **When** the developer extracts it to `packages/` or `apps/`, **Then** the migration is documented in the feature spec with the git commit SHA of the original notebook before deletion
2. **Given** a compliance or evaluation notebook contains regulatory documentation, **When** code is migrated to production, **Then** the notebook is retained in its original category and tagged in git for audit trail (e.g., `compliance/model-v1.0-audit`)
3. **Given** an exploratory notebook is migrated to production, **When** the developer deletes it after migration, **Then** the feature spec documents the migration with git references to the deleted notebook's last commit

---

### User Story 5 - EU AI Act Compliance Documentation (Priority: P5)

A compliance officer needs to generate technical documentation for a high-risk AI system using notebooks as evidence.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for regulated systems but only applies to production-adjacent notebooks for high-risk AI systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a production-adjacent notebook with model evaluation metrics and verifying that it includes all required EU AI Act documentation elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a production-adjacent notebook evaluates a model, **When** it is reviewed for compliance, **Then** it documents training data characteristics, evaluation metrics, and risk assessment findings
2. **Given** a model selection decision is made, **When** documented in a notebook, **Then** the notebook provides an audit trail showing why the model was chosen
3. **Given** a compliance officer needs technical documentation, **When** they review production-adjacent notebooks, **Then** they find all required information for the homologation dossier

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer accidentally commits a notebook with credentials before the pre-commit hook is installed?
- How does the system handle notebooks that are too large to be stored in git (e.g., with embedded large datasets)? → Notebooks over 10 MB are blocked; developers must externalize data to separate files or data sources
- What happens when a notebook depends on external data sources that are no longer available?
- How does the system handle notebooks that take hours to execute?
- What happens when a notebook is moved between categories (e.g., from exploratory to compliance)?
- How does the system handle notebooks that use different Python versions or incompatible dependencies?
- What happens when a notebook needs to be shared publicly but contains references to internal systems?
- How do developers discover deleted exploratory notebooks from git history when needed?
- What happens when a compliance notebook needs to be updated after being tagged for audit?
- How does the system handle experiment tracking metadata when notebooks are deleted or migrated?

### Future Considerations

- **Experiment Tracking System**: The ALLiaNCE data stack currently lacks a standardized experiment tracking solution. A future constitution amendment should propose a principle for experiment tracking (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases, or a sovereign French solution) to complement notebook-based workflows. This would provide structured metadata capture, model versioning, and reproducibility beyond what git-native approaches offer.

- **Unified CLI Extensibility**: The ai-kit CLI architecture (`apps/cli/`) is designed to accommodate future command groups beyond notebooks. Anticipated extensions include:
  - **Dataset commands**: `just dataset download`, `just dataset list`, `just dataset validate` for data management
  - **Streamlit commands**: `just streamlit run`, `just streamlit deploy` for Streamlit application lifecycle
  - **Compliance commands**: `just compliance tag`, `just compliance report`, `just compliance audit` for regulatory workflows
  - **Experiment commands**: `just experiment start`, `just experiment log`, `just experiment compare` when experiment tracking is standardized
  - **ProConnect commands**: `just proconnect setup`, `just proconnect test` for authentication configuration
  
  The extensible architecture ensures consistent DX across all ai-kit operations and enables rapid feature additions without structural refactoring.

## Terminology

**Key Terms**:
- **ai-kit CLI**: The unified command-line interface application for all ai-kit operations, located in `apps/cli/` with namespace `ai_kit.cli`. Accessed via `just <command-group> <subcommand>` pattern (e.g., `just notebook create`).
- **Compliance Officer**: A governance oversight role responsible for reviewing compliance and evaluation notebooks and creating git tags during audit/review process. This role may be filled by intrapreneurs (internal innovation champions) or ALLiaNCE experts (external domain specialists).
- **Notebook Category**: One of six organizational classifications (exploratory, tutorials, evaluations, compliance, reporting, templates) that determines governance requirements and lifecycle management for notebooks.
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Automated validation that runs before git commits to enforce security, quality, and metadata requirements.
- **Git Tag**: A named reference to a specific commit, used by compliance officers to mark regulatory milestones for compliance and evaluation notebooks (format: `category/identifier-date`).

### Key Entities

- **Notebook Category**: Represents the governance level and purpose of a notebook. Six categories exist:

  - `exploratory/`: Rapid experimentation, hypothesis testing (one-time, low governance, deleted after migration)
  - `tutorials/`: Learning materials, examples, how-to guides (reusable, documentation standards, retained)
  - `evaluations/`: Model performance assessment and validation (per model version, medium governance, retained and tagged)
  - `compliance/`: EU AI Act and regulatory documentation (per system, high governance, retained and tagged)
  - `reporting/`: Automated, parameterized stakeholder reports (recurring, medium governance, retained)
  - `templates/`: Starter notebooks with proper structure (reference materials, retained)

- **Notebook Template**: Provides starter structure for each active category including required metadata fields in the first markdown cell (purpose, author, category, dependencies, data sources), security guidelines, and category-specific requirements. Stored in `templates/` directory. Pre-commit hooks validate these metadata fields are present.

- **Security Violation**: Represents detected security issues in notebooks such as hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive data patterns. Includes violation type, location, and remediation guidance.

- **Migration Record**: Documents the transition of notebook code to production, including source notebook git commit SHA (for deleted exploratory notebooks) or current path (for retained compliance/evaluation notebooks), destination package/app, migration date, and rationale. Uses git references to link deleted notebooks to their production counterparts.

- **Git Tag Reference**: Represents a git tag created by compliance officers (intrapreneurs or ALLiaNCE experts) during audit/review, marking a compliance or evaluation notebook milestone (e.g., `compliance/model-v1.0-audit`, `evaluation/baseline-2024-10-14`). Enables easy discovery of regulatory documentation without maintaining separate archive directory. May integrate with experiment tracking system metadata.

- **Compliance Documentation**: Represents EU AI Act and GDPR compliance information captured in compliance notebooks, including training data characteristics, risk assessments, and audit trails for model selection decisions.

- **Evaluation Record**: Documents model performance metrics, validation methodology, and benchmark comparisons captured in evaluation notebooks. Supports production deployment decisions.

- **Dependency Specification**: Defines the runtime requirements for a notebook including Python version, required packages, data sources, and environment variables. Ensures reproducibility across different execution environments.

- **Compliance Officer**: Represents governance oversight role (intrapreneur or ALLiaNCE expert) responsible for reviewing compliance and evaluation notebooks and creating git tags during audit/review process. Ensures regulatory documentation meets EU AI Act and homologation requirements before tagging milestones.

- **ai-kit CLI Application**: Unified command-line interface (`apps/cli/`) providing consistent access to all ai-kit operations. Extensible architecture with command groups (notebook, dataset, streamlit, compliance, experiment) enables future feature additions without structural changes. Implements shared infrastructure for validation, prompts, git operations, and formatted output across all commands.

- **Notebook Command Group**: Collection of notebook lifecycle management commands within ai-kit CLI. Includes `create` (interactive notebook creation), `list` (browse by category), `validate` (manual validation), `delete` (safe deletion with git guidance), `migrate` (document production migration), and `stats` (repository statistics). Accessed via `just notebook <subcommand>`.
