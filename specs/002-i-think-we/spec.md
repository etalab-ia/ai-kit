# Feature Specification: Jupyter Notebook Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-think-we`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I think we are ready now to support notebooks as specified in our constitution."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Security-Compliant Notebook Creation (Priority: P1)

A data scientist needs to create a new exploratory notebook to analyze model performance without risking credential leakage or compliance violations.

**Why this priority**: Security requirements are non-negotiable and must be enforced from the first notebook commit. This prevents the most critical risk: accidental exposure of credentials or sensitive data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a notebook with test credentials, committing it, and verifying that outputs are stripped and no credentials are committed to version control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a new notebook in `notebooks/exploratory/`, **When** they commit the notebook with cell outputs, **Then** the pre-commit hook automatically strips all outputs before commit
2. **Given** a developer attempts to commit a notebook with hardcoded credentials, **When** the pre-commit hook runs, **Then** the commit is blocked with a clear error message indicating the security violation
3. **Given** a developer creates a notebook, **When** they reference the notebook template, **Then** they see clear documentation on security requirements and how to use environment variables for credentials

---

### User Story 2 - Organized Notebook Categories (Priority: P2)

A team member needs to understand where to place their notebook based on its purpose and governance requirements.

**Why this priority**: Clear categorization prevents confusion and ensures appropriate governance is applied. This is the foundation for all other notebook workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating notebooks in each category directory and verifying that the correct governance rules and documentation standards are enforced for each.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer wants to do rapid experimentation, **When** they create a notebook in `notebooks/exploratory/`, **Then** they can work freely without SpecKit workflow requirements
2. **Given** a developer creates a tutorial notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/tutorials/`, **Then** they are prompted to follow documentation standards and link it to relevant specs
3. **Given** a developer creates a model evaluation notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/evaluations/`, **Then** they are prompted to document performance metrics and validation methodology
4. **Given** a developer creates a compliance documentation notebook, **When** they place it in `notebooks/compliance/`, **Then** they are prompted to document EU AI Act requirements and risk assessments
5. **Given** a developer creates a recurring stakeholder report, **When** they place it in `notebooks/reporting/`, **Then** they are prompted to parameterize it for automated execution
6. **Given** a developer needs a starter notebook, **When** they copy from `notebooks/templates/`, **Then** they get a pre-structured notebook with required metadata and security guidance
7. **Given** a notebook is no longer needed, **When** it is moved to `notebooks/archive/`, **Then** it is preserved for audit purposes but excluded from active development

---

### User Story 3 - Reproducible Notebook Execution (Priority: P3)

A team member needs to run someone else's notebook and get the same results without dependency conflicts.

**Why this priority**: Reproducibility is essential for collaboration and compliance, but can be established after security and organization are in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having one developer create a notebook with dependencies, another developer clone the repository, and successfully execute the notebook with identical results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a notebook has documented dependencies, **When** a developer sets up the environment using the documented requirements, **Then** the notebook executes successfully without errors
2. **Given** a notebook uses data sources, **When** another developer runs it, **Then** they can access the same data sources through documented paths or environment variables
3. **Given** a notebook is parameterized, **When** it is executed programmatically with different parameters, **Then** it produces consistent results for the same inputs

---

### User Story 4 - Notebook-to-Production Migration (Priority: P4)

A developer has validated an approach in a notebook and needs to migrate it to production code in the monorepo.

**Why this priority**: This enables the value of exploration to reach production, but only after the foundational notebook infrastructure is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an exploratory notebook, extracting its logic to a package, documenting the migration, and archiving the original notebook.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an exploratory notebook has validated code, **When** the developer extracts it to `packages/` or `apps/`, **Then** the migration is documented in the feature spec with a link to the archived notebook
2. **Given** a production-adjacent notebook contains compliance documentation, **When** code is migrated to production, **Then** the notebook is retained for audit purposes and referenced in the compliance dossier
3. **Given** a notebook is migrated to production, **When** it is moved to `notebooks/archive/`, **Then** it includes metadata about when it was migrated and where the production code lives

---

### User Story 5 - EU AI Act Compliance Documentation (Priority: P5)

A compliance officer needs to generate technical documentation for a high-risk AI system using notebooks as evidence.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for regulated systems but only applies to production-adjacent notebooks for high-risk AI systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a production-adjacent notebook with model evaluation metrics and verifying that it includes all required EU AI Act documentation elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a production-adjacent notebook evaluates a model, **When** it is reviewed for compliance, **Then** it documents training data characteristics, evaluation metrics, and risk assessment findings
2. **Given** a model selection decision is made, **When** documented in a notebook, **Then** the notebook provides an audit trail showing why the model was chosen
3. **Given** a compliance officer needs technical documentation, **When** they review production-adjacent notebooks, **Then** they find all required information for the homologation dossier

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer accidentally commits a notebook with credentials before the pre-commit hook is installed?
- How does the system handle notebooks that are too large to be stored in git (e.g., with embedded large datasets)?
- What happens when a notebook depends on external data sources that are no longer available?
- How does the system handle notebooks that take hours to execute?
- What happens when a notebook is moved between categories (e.g., from exploratory to production-adjacent)?
- How does the system handle notebooks that use different Python versions or incompatible dependencies?
- What happens when a notebook needs to be shared publicly but contains references to internal systems?

### Key Entities

- **Notebook Category**: Represents the governance level and purpose of a notebook. Seven categories exist:
  - `exploratory/`: Rapid experimentation, hypothesis testing (one-time, low governance)
  - `tutorials/`: Learning materials, examples, how-to guides (reusable, documentation standards)
  - `evaluations/`: Model performance assessment and validation (per model version, medium governance)
  - `compliance/`: EU AI Act and regulatory documentation (per system, high governance)
  - `reporting/`: Automated, parameterized stakeholder reports (recurring, medium governance)
  - `templates/`: Starter notebooks with proper structure (reference materials)
  - `archive/`: Completed work preserved for audit trail (historical record)

- **Notebook Template**: Provides starter structure for each active category including required metadata (purpose, author, dependencies, data sources), security guidelines, and category-specific requirements. Stored in `templates/` directory.

- **Security Violation**: Represents detected security issues in notebooks such as hardcoded credentials, API keys, or sensitive data patterns. Includes violation type, location, and remediation guidance.

- **Migration Record**: Documents the transition of notebook code to production, including source notebook location, destination package/app, migration date, and rationale. Links archived notebooks to their production counterparts.

- **Compliance Documentation**: Represents EU AI Act and GDPR compliance information captured in compliance notebooks, including training data characteristics, risk assessments, and audit trails for model selection decisions.

- **Evaluation Record**: Documents model performance metrics, validation methodology, and benchmark comparisons captured in evaluation notebooks. Supports production deployment decisions.

- **Dependency Specification**: Defines the runtime requirements for a notebook including Python version, required packages, data sources, and environment variables. Ensures reproducibility across different execution environments.
